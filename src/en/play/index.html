          As a sport, <strong>Jugger is a work in progress: we don't yet have a single global ruleset!</strong> There are around 20 different national and local variants.  Most of these variants agree on basic rules, but there are differences in areas like refereeing and dimensions of equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most widely used rulesets are the German, Spanish, and Australian rulesets.  We're currently working on a tool to help players understand these different rulesets - in the meantime, check out the International Jugger Blog’s Rulebooks compilation!
