    <p>
      As of 2020, there isn’t a single, unified ruleset for playing jugger across the world. There are around 20 different national and local variants, most of which agree on the basics but differ in certain areas like refereeing or the exact measures of the spars.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re currently working on creating a comparative database for the German, Spanish and Australian rules - in the meantime, check out the International Jugger Blog’s Rulebooks compilation!

      Currently, there are jugger clubs in thirty countries across Europe, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Check our Jugger World Map to see if there’s any such group near you - but if there isn’t, grab your friends and start one!

      Have you just discovered jugger and want to bring it closer to home? Are you already a jugger player and wish to take your favourite sport when you move to a new town? Worry not! We are currently working on a full guide to founding your own club, and another on how to organize jugger competitions.

    <p>
      A very important part of the jugger experience is to meet and stay in touch with new people, on the local, national, and even international level. To facilitate this, we have compiled a list of relevant online contact addresses, social media accounts, and forums from all over the world.  We're also working on a form to help clubs and organizations keep this up to date.
