      Do you coach other Juggers, promote your club locally, organize tournaments, or otherwise hold a position of leadership or seniority in your local Jugger organization?  The IJC Code of Conduct provides a useful starting point to help you create an safe, enjoyable and inclusive environment for the sport of Jugger.
