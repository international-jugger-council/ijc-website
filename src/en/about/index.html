      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            The International Jugger Council was founded in 2019 to serve as a representative body for the worldwide jugger community.   This map shows IJC member countries and organizations around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Council comprises 1-3 Representatives from each member country, and each nation’s representatives share one vote. The Council elects a Board every year, which calls ordinary meetings every October and April and extraordinary meetings whenever the situation requires it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the Council has agreed on setting a new goal for the IJC, the Board establishes a Committee to work on it.
