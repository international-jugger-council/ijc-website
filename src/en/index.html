          <strong>Jugger is a mixed (co-ed) contact sport</strong> where two teams of five players, outfitted with padded spars, compete to grab a ball placed in the center of the field and bring it to the opponent’s goal. The game was developed in its current form in Germany during the early 90’s, and is currently played in 30 countries across the world.

    <h3 class="is-size-2">How the IJC Works</h3>
    <p>
      The International Jugger Council was founded in 2019 to serve as a representative body for the worldwide jugger community.   This map shows IJC member countries and organizations around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Council comprises 1-3 Representatives from each member country, and each nation’s representatives share one vote. The Council elects a Board every year, which calls ordinary meetings every October and April and extraordinary meetings whenever the situation requires it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the Council has agreed on setting a new goal for the IJC, the Board establishes a Committee to work on it.
