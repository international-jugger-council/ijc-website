      As a sport, <strong>Jugger is a work in progress: we don't yet have a single global ruleset!</strong> There are around 20 different national and local variants.  Most of these variants agree on basic rules, but there are differences in areas like refereeing and dimensions of equipment.

      The most widely used rulesets are the German, Spanish, and Australian rulesets.  We're currently working on a tool to help players understand these different rulesets - in the meantime, check out the International Jugger Blogâ€™s Rulebooks compilation!
